**Description:** 
The problem aims at the development of an elastic cloud application leveraging IaaS resources from Amazon Web Services (AWS) to provide an image recognition service to users. The objective is to create an application capable of automatically scaling in and out on-demand while ensuring cost-effectiveness. The application will take user-uploaded images as input and utilize a deep-learning model to perform image recognition. The challenge lies in efficiently handling concurrent user requests, scaling resources linearly within a specified limit (not exceeding 20 instances), queuing pending requests when the limit is reached, and persistently storing both input images and recognition results in separate S3 buckets.
